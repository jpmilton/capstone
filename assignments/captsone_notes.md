# Analysis of Indian Restaurants in and around Brick Lane, London

of the crimes of Jack the Ripper murders, and home to the old Truman Brewery, it now has become a hub for the local
artistic community featuring galleries, markets and festivals a throughout the year.

Being the centre of the local Bangladesh community, Brick Lane has gained the reputation as the centre of authentic
Indian cuisine in London. This analysis examines the density of Indian restaurants in and around Brick Lane, and asks the 
question whether this reputation is deserved. Is there a high density of restaurants, and how well are they rated by 
their patrons? Is Brick Lane a centre of good quality Indian cuisine, or is it a tourist trap?

This region of London is also home to many up and coming technology companies. The *Old Street Roundabout*, 
nicknamed *The Silicon Roundabout*, refers to the area between Old Street and Shoreditch, which has a high concentration
of technology businesses and start ups, and neighbours Brick Lane.

as potential customers in this area, Brick Lane is a potential location to site a new restaurant, being walking distance
